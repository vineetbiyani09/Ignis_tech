## About the Project
This project aims at providing free web-monitoring for various types of sneakers.
The monitor currently notify about the availability of some selected sneakers (JORDAN MID, JORDAN HIGH, JORDAN LOW, DUNK) and complete information about the product via Discord Webhook.

I will be working on this project to add some more features to it.
